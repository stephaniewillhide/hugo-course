description: In these ways the course was a good refresher

The course was similar to the Youtube videos put out by Mike Dane in many ways. However, having worked with Hugo a bit so far, it was nice to have a refresher. For example, it was nice to use `hugo new site quickstart` and start from scratch once again.

I had largely forgotten about

 * Downloading Themes
 * posts with `draft: true` in frontmatter won't render unless you specify
 * Using the terminal to create new posts
 * Archetypes being used to prefill frontmatter
 * Taxonomies and how you customize them
