The course went over downloading themes from the command line. Some of themes are no longer around as this is an older course.

The instructor pointed out that taking a look at themes to figure things out was a good point; this is something I do often.

Putting archetypes, css, or layouts can be added to your file and the theme will be overridden.

`hugo new theme (theme name)` is the command to enter if you'd like to create your own theme.
